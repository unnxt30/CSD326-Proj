**Use Case ID:** UC-004  

## Use Case Title  
Assess Road Condition  

## Description  
This use case allows a supervisor to assess the condition of a road after receiving a repair request. The supervisor reviews details, validates citizen input, and determines the severity of the issue.  

## Actors  
- **Primary Actor:** Supervisor  
- **Secondary Actor:** System  

## Preconditions  
- The supervisor must be logged into the system.  
- The repair request must be available in the system.  

## Postconditions  
- The system updates the repair request with the assessment details.  
- The supervisor determines whether further action is required.  

## Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)  
1. The supervisor logs into the system.  
2. The supervisor navigates to "View Repair Requests."  
3. The supervisor selects a repair request to assess.  
4. The system displays road details and past reports.  
5. The supervisor physically inspects the road condition.  
6. The supervisor validates the citizen's input and updates the request.  
7. If needed, the supervisor uploads additional findings.  
8. The system records the assessment and updates the request status.  

## Alternative Flows (Extensions)  
- **[Step 4] No Past Reports Available** → The system notifies the supervisor and allows manual input.  
- **[Step 6] Input Invalid or Incomplete** → The supervisor requests additional details from the citizen.  
- **[Step 7] Supervisor Cannot Inspect Road** → The system allows delegation to another supervisor.  

## Frequency of Use  
As needed when new repair requests are submitted.  

## Business Rules  
- Only authorized supervisors can assess road conditions.  
- The system must maintain historical assessments for reference.  

## Assumptions  
- The supervisor has access to the affected location.  
- The system allows real-time updates.  

## Notes
