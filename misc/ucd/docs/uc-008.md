**Use Case ID:** UC-008  

## Use Case Title  
Update Repair Progress  

## Description  
This use case allows a supervisor to update the status of ongoing repair work. The supervisor can mark tasks as completed, log delays, and send updates to citizens. The system reflects these updates in real time.  

## Actors

- **Secondary Actors:** System, Citizens  

## Preconditions

- Citizens are notified of progress updates.  

## Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)  
1. The supervisor logs into the system.  
2. The supervisor selects "Update Repair Progress."  
3. The system retrieves ongoing repair tasks.  
4. The supervisor selects a repair task.

6. If needed, the supervisor adds notes about unexpected delays.  
7. The system updates the repair status.  
8. The system notifies citizens of the updated status.  

## Alternative Flows (Extensions)  
- **[Step 5] Task Delayed** → The supervisor logs the reason and adjusts the estimated completion time.  
- **[Step 6] Supervisor Cannot Update** → The system allows delegation to another supervisor.  
- **[Step 8] Notifications Disabled by Citizen** → The system logs updates but does not send alerts.  

## Frequency of Use
