# Schedule Repair Work

**Use Case ID:** UC-007  

**Use Case Title:** Schedule Repair Work  

## Description  
This use case allows a supervisor to schedule a repair task based on priority, available resources, and urgency. The system updates the repair schedule and notifies the workers and administrators.

## Actors  
- **Primary Actor:** Supervisor  
- **Secondary Actor:** System, Administrator, Workers  

## Preconditions  
- The supervisor must be logged into the system.  
- The repair request must have an assigned priority.  
- Resource requirements must be estimated.  

## Postconditions  
- The system updates the repair schedule.  
- Workers and administrators receive notifications.  

## Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)  
1. The supervisor logs into the system.  
2. The supervisor selects "Schedule Repair Work."  
3. The system retrieves prioritized repair requests.  
4. The supervisor assigns a repair date and team.  
5. The system verifies resource availability.  
6. The supervisor confirms the schedule.  
7. The system updates the repair schedule.  
8. The system notifies the assigned workers and the administrator.  

## Alternative Flows (Extensions)  
- **[Step 4] No Workers Available** → The supervisor selects an alternative date or requests additional workers.  
- **[Step 5] Insufficient Resources** → The system alerts the administrator for resource reallocation.  
- **[Step 6] Urgent Request Identified** → The system prioritizes the repair and reschedules lower-priority tasks.  

## Frequency of Use  
Daily, depending on the number of repair requests.  

## Business Rules  
- Only supervisors can schedule repair work.  
- Urgent repairs must be scheduled within 24 hours.  

## Assumptions  
- The system has an updated worker availability database.  
- The administrator can manually override scheduling conflicts.  

## Notes
