# Use Case: Estimate Resource Requirements

**Use Case ID:** UC-006  

**Use Case Title:** Estimate Resource Requirements  

## Description  
This use case allows a supervisor to estimate the required resources for a repair request. The supervisor calculates manpower, equipment, and materials needed and updates the system accordingly.

## Actors  
- **Primary Actor:** Supervisor  
- **Secondary Actor:** System, Administrator  

## Preconditions  
- The supervisor must be logged into the system.  
- The repair request must have a priority assigned.  

## Postconditions  
- The system updates the request with estimated resources.  
- If resources are insufficient, the system notifies the administrator.  

## Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)  
1. The supervisor logs into the system.  
2. The supervisor navigates to "View Repair Requests."  
3. The supervisor selects a prioritized repair request.  
4. The system displays repair details.  
5. The supervisor estimates the manpower and equipment required.  
6. The supervisor calculates the materials needed.  
7. The system records the estimated resources.  
8. If resources are insufficient, the system notifies the administrator.  

## Alternative Flows (Extensions)  
- **[Step 5] Supervisor Needs Additional Data** → The system allows consulting previous repair records.  
- **[Step 6] Resource Estimates Incorrect** → The supervisor can update estimates before submission.  
- **[Step 8] Administrator Adjusts Resource Allocation** → The administrator reallocates resources if needed.  

## Frequency of Use  
Every time a repair request is scheduled.  

## Business Rules  
- Only prioritized repair requests can be estimated for resources.  
- Supervisors must follow resource estimation guidelines.  

## Assumptions  
- The system maintains an updated inventory of resources.  
- The administrator can override resource estimates if necessary.  

## Notes  
- Future versions may automate resource estimation using AI.
