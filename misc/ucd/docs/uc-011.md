# Use Case ID: UC-011  

## Use Case Title: Reschedule Repairs  

### Description  
This use case allows an administrator to modify the schedule of repair work based on resource availability, priority changes, or unforeseen delays. The system updates the schedule and notifies all relevant stakeholders.  

### Primary Actor  
**Administrator**  

### Secondary Actor  
**System, Supervisor, Workers**  

### Preconditions  
- The administrator must be logged into the system.  
- The repair work must already be scheduled.  
- Resource constraints or priority changes must necessitate rescheduling.  

### Postconditions  
- The system updates the repair schedule.  
- Workers and supervisors receive notifications of the new schedule.  

### Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)  
1. The administrator logs into the system.  
2. The administrator navigates to "Reschedule Repairs."  
3. The system displays the current repair schedule.  
4. The administrator selects a repair task that needs rescheduling.  
5. The administrator modifies the repair date, time, or assigned workers.  
6. The system verifies resource availability for the new schedule.  
7. The administrator confirms the changes.  
8. The system updates the schedule and notifies affected parties.  

### Alternative Flows (Extensions)  
- **[Step 5] No Alternative Date Available** → The administrator requests supervisor input for adjustments.  
- **[Step 6] Insufficient Resources** → The system notifies the administrator to adjust allocations.  
- **[Step 8] Notification Failure** → The system logs the update but retries sending notifications.  

### Frequency of Use  
As needed, depending on resource availability and priority shifts.  

### Business Rules  
- High-priority repairs must be rescheduled within 24 hours.  
- Workers must be notified at least 12 hours before schedule changes.  

### Assumptions  
- The system has an up-to-date resource availability database.  
- The administrator has authority to override scheduling conflicts.  

### Notes  
- Future versions may allow automatic rescheduling based on AI predictions.
