# Use Case: Manage Available Resources

**Use Case ID:** UC-009  

**Use Case Title:** Manage Available Resources  

## Description  
This use case allows an administrator to manage and allocate available resources, such as manpower, equipment, and materials, for repair work. The system updates resource availability in real-time.

## Actors  
- **Primary Actor:** Administrator  
- **Secondary Actor:** System  

## Preconditions  
- The administrator must be logged into the system.  
- The system must have an up-to-date inventory of resources.  

## Postconditions  
- The system updates available resources.  
- Scheduled repairs reflect allocated resources.  

## Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)  
1. The administrator logs into the system.  
2. The administrator navigates to "Manage Available Resources."  
3. The system displays the current inventory of manpower, equipment, and materials.  
4. The administrator reviews the resource allocation for scheduled repairs.  
5. The administrator updates the availability of resources.  
6. If necessary, the administrator reallocates resources to high-priority repairs.  
7. The system updates resource availability and notifies relevant stakeholders.  

## Alternative Flows (Extensions)  
- **[Step 5] Insufficient Resources Available** → The administrator requests additional resources from suppliers.  
- **[Step 6] Urgent Repair Identified** → The administrator prioritizes resource allocation for urgent cases.  
- **[Step 7] System Error in Updating Resources** → The system logs the error and prompts manual intervention.  

## Frequency of Use  
As needed, depending on repair demands and resource usage.  

## Business Rules  
- Only authorized administrators can update resource availability.  
- High-priority repairs must receive resource allocation first.  

## Assumptions  
- The system maintains an accurate real-time inventory.  
- The administrator has authority to override resource allocations if needed.  

## Notes  
- Future versions may integrate automated resource forecasting based on AI.
