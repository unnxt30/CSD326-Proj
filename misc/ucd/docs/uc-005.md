# Use Case: Determine Repair Priority

## Use Case ID: UC-005  

## Use Case Title: Determine Repair Priority  

### Description  
This use case allows a supervisor to assign a priority level to a repair request based on the severity of the road condition, location, and urgency. The system records the assigned priority and updates the repair request accordingly.

### Primary Actor  
**Supervisor**  

### Secondary Actor  
**System**  

### Preconditions  
- The supervisor must be logged into the system.  
- The road condition must have been assessed.  
- The repair request must be available in the system.  

### Postconditions  
- The system updates the repair request with a priority level.  
- The request is sorted accordingly in the repair schedule.  

### Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)  
1. The supervisor logs into the system.  
2. The supervisor navigates to "View Repair Requests."  
3. The supervisor selects a repair request that has been assessed.  
4. The system displays the road condition details and location data.  
5. The supervisor assigns a priority level (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).  
6. If additional data is needed, the supervisor requests more information from the citizen.  
7. The system updates the request with the assigned priority.  
8. The repair request is automatically queued based on priority.  

### Alternative Flows (Extensions)  
- **[Step 5] Supervisor Needs More Data** → The system allows the supervisor to request additional details from the citizen.  
- **[Step 6] Request Marked as Urgent** → The system notifies the administrator for immediate resource allocation.  
- **[Step 7] Priority Assignment Error** → The system prompts the supervisor to re-enter a valid priority level.  

### Frequency of Use  
Every time a new repair request is assessed.  

### Business Rules  
- Only assessed repair requests can be prioritized.  
- Critical priority requests must be reviewed within 24 hours.  

### Assumptions  
- The supervisor has access to priority guidelines.  
- The system supports automated prioritization based on predefined rules.  

### Notes  
- Future versions may integrate AI-based priority assignment.
