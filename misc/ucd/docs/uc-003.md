### Preconditions  
- The supervisor must have valid login credentials.  
- The system must be online and accessible.  

### Postconditions

- The system retrieves and displays repair requests with relevant details.  

### Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)  
1. The supervisor navigates to the login page.  
2. The supervisor enters valid credentials and submits them.  
3. The system verifies the credentials.
