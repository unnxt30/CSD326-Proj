**Use Case ID:** UC-010  

## Use Case Title  
**Update Resource Availability**  

## Description  
This use case allows an administrator to update the availability of manpower, equipment, and materials. The system tracks used and remaining resources in real time and ensures efficient allocation for upcoming repairs.

## Actors  
- **Primary Actor:** Administrator  
- **Secondary Actor:** System  

## Preconditions  
- The administrator must be logged into the system.  
- The system must have an updated inventory of resources.  

## Postconditions  
- The system updates the resource inventory.  
- Repair scheduling reflects updated resource availability.  

## Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)  
1. The administrator logs into the system.  
2. The administrator navigates to "Update Resource Availability."  
3. The system displays current resource levels.  
4. The administrator updates the quantity of manpower, equipment, or materials.  
5. The system verifies the update and adjusts availability accordingly.  
6. The administrator confirms the changes.  
7. The system records the update and notifies relevant stakeholders.  

## Alternative Flows (Extensions)  
- **[Step 4] Insufficient Resources Available** → The system alerts the administrator to request additional supplies.  
- **[Step 5] Data Entry Error** → The system prompts the administrator to review and correct inputs.  
- **[Step 7] Notification Failure** → The system logs the update but retries sending notifications.  

## Frequency of Use  
As needed, based on repair demands and resource consumption.  

## Business Rules  
- Only authorized administrators can update resource availability.  
- System must prevent double allocation of critical resources.  

## Assumptions  
- The system maintains an accurate, real-time inventory.  
- The administrator has access to resource consumption reports.  

## Notes  
- Future versions may integrate predictive resource planning based on AI.
