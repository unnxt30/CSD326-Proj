## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the **City Road Maintenance and Service Management System**. This system will enable residents to access information about city facilities, raise repair requests for roads, and track the progress of repair work. Additionally, it will assist supervisors in managing repair requests, prioritizing work, and scheduling repairs based on resource availability. The system will also provide statistical reports for the mayor and city administrators.  

### 1.2 Scope  
The scope of this project is to develop a web-based system that serves the residents of a city with a population exceeding 5 lakh. The system will handle up to 10 concurrent clicks per second and will be used for road maintenance activities. It will allow residents to raise repair requests, supervisors to manage and prioritize repairs, and administrators to manage resources. The system will also generate reports for the mayor and city administrators.  

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations  
- **Resident**: A citizen of the city who uses the system to raise repair requests and view progress.  
- **Supervisor**: A city corporation employee responsible for inspecting roads, prioritizing repairs, and managing resources.  
- **Administrator**: A city corporation employee responsible for managing available manpower and machines.  
- **Mayor**: The city mayor who requests statistical reports on road repairs.  
- **Repair Request**: A request raised by a resident for road repair.  
- **Priority**: The level of urgency assigned to a repair request based on severity and locality.  

### 1.4 References  
- City Corporation Road Maintenance Guidelines  
- Web Development Standards (W3C)  
- HTTP/HTTPS Protocol Documentation  

### 1.5 Overview  
This document provides a detailed description of the City Road Maintenance and Service Management System. Section 2 provides an overall description of the system, including user characteristics and major features. Section 3 outlines the specific requirements, including functionality, usability, reliability, performance, security, and design constraints. Section 4 contains supporting information.
